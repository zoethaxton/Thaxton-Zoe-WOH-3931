# Analysis 1 - North Africa and the Mediterranean Theatre (Nick)
 
The United States’ military involvement in North Africa, primarily through Operation Torch, set the stage for the conclusion of the Mediterranean Theatre in 1944. Prior to American intervention, the British and Germans were locked in a heated battle in the deserts of Egypt and Libya, with neither side gaining a clear advantage. However, in 1942, the British and American militaries agreed to a joint operation in French North Africa, with the hopes to corner the Axis forces following a presumed British victory in the Western Desert campaign. Following the success of this pincer movement, the successes of the Allied Invasion of Sicily and Operation Dragoon ended the Mediterranean Theatre with an Allied victory.

Operation Torch’s planning was a balancing act performed by General Dwight Eisenhower, who planned a series of objectives as a compromise between the American desire to land near the Atlantic, and the British impulse to attack further east, closer to the Axis forces. Aside from the large-scale planning, the military logistics were also difficult. The U.S. Navy’s Atlantic Fleet was less advanced and numerous than its Pacific counterpart, and Eisenhower had to plan without specific knowledge of the number of vessels he would command. Eventually, the Americans suggested synchronous landings at Casablanca, Oran, and Algiers, which the British would agree to. The Casablanca force consisted primarily of Americans, the Oran force combined American troops stationed in the United Kingdom with British troops, and the Algiers force was also a combinatory group.

Often ignored in the story of Operation Torch is the aforementioned logistic struggle; American and British miscommunication caused unnecessary confusion. At first, Eisenhower believed that the North African operation would be looked down upon as history progressed, as most high-level American officials sought an invasion of Continental Europe. Even after American and British officials agreed on a North African invasion, they disagreed on where to land the forces. They settled on the three landing sites with a simultaneous landing, but still had mishap after mishap. For instance, a regiment with its equipment arrived in fifty-five different ships, poor British warehouse and American communication procedures slowed transport down, and over six weeks’ worth of supplies were lost at sea. Despite these initial issues, the United States military apparatus worked with intelligence in some aspects, including transporting necessary blood plasma with a combination of flares and bombers. American contribution to the innovations that helped in Operation Torch, including the air doctrine of the day, is also underrated in many retellings of the invasion.

The joint American-British forces successfully captured each of the three main objectives in Operation Torch without major incident. Following this, and British victory in the Western Desert campaign, the Americans worked with their longtime allies to attempt to quickly occupy Tunisia. This campaign would see far more resistance than the Operation Torch landings. The Run for Tunis, the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid, and the Battle of Kasserine Pass were all Axis victories that inflicted varying degrees of loss on the U.S. military. The Battle of Kasserine Pass was especially painful, and led to Eisenhower bringing on General George Patton, signaling a trend of increased experience following these losses. Patton comments on the Tunisian Campaign in a diary entry from April 1943, saying that although the Tunisian Campaign had operational confusion, it was “much closer to a perfect solution than [Operation] Torch…” Indeed, the tides later turned, with the previously underestimated U.S. Air Force playing a major role in taking Tunis and completing the Tunisian Campaign. Erwin Rommel in particular underestimated the American troops, holding the belief that while British troops were a formidable match for the German troops, the Americans were a couple legs beneath in combat ability. Huge supply reinforcements for the collective Allied Air Force quickly changed the tides. In a matter of months, the Allies went from horrible defeat to complete victory in the African continent. Kasserine Pass concluded in late February 1943, and the Tunisian campaign ended in the middle of May that year. This drastic turn of events sped up the rate at which the Allies were able to enter the European continent. Although the succeeding operations did not have the same effect on the success of the war effort, they represented the extent to which the sleeping giant of the American military-industrial complex had been awakened.

After their victory in North Africa, the Americans continued to push into the Mediterranean, beginning with the Allied Invasion of Sicily in Operation Husky. Led by General Patton, Allied forces quickly occupied Sicily, forcing the fall of the Italian government. This victory also prompted Hitler to divert forces from a planned offensive in Kursk to protect the Axis’ interests in Italy, highlighting the compounding effects of American involvement in each theatre of the War. The Allies then attempted to capture Rome, but were faced with the strong German Winter Line, which was only broken in spring 1944, about six months after the initial landing. In June 1944, Rome fell, and the Americans focused their European efforts on Normandy.

The finale of American involvement in the Mediterranean theater came in Operation Dragoon, where they landed in Southern France to gain control of coastal ports and open a new front against the Germans. The Americans quickly forced the Germans to retreat from Southern France and inflicted some casualties while they did so. The speed of the Allied advance was extraordinary; they traveled so quickly that they experienced fuel shortages while pursuing the retreating German army group. The soldiers taking part in this operation then unified with other groups on the Western Front, generally concluding American involvement in the Mediterranean Theatre.

The United States played an instrumental role in the Mediterranean theatre: with its industrial might and showcases of wartime strategy, Operation Torch broke the stalemate in Africa, setting the stage for the rest of the operations. The Tunisian Campaign followed in the immediate aftermath, giving the Allies victory in Northern Africa. Lastly, the success of Operations Husky and Dragoon united troop columns from the Mediterranean theatre with the troops on the Western Front. American involvement in the Mediterranean, along with the theatre as a whole, is often neglected in the public conscience. However, the role both played in the Allied victory should be highlighted as it involves an entire oft-neglected continent.


# Analysis 2 - European Theatre (Suzanne)

America's involvement prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor had been shrouded under a statement of neutrality, though the nation provided support to the Allied powers through indirect means. The Lend-Lease Act of March 1941 exemplified this complex diplomatic approach, allowing the United States to supply critical war materials to Britain, the Soviet Union, and other Allied nations without direct military engagement. These supplies—including food, oil, munitions, and industrial equipment—became lifelines for Allied resistance, effectively making the United States an arsenal of democracy while technically maintaining neutrality. The shift in power following the United States' entry into the war proved pivotal in orchestrating the decline of the Third Reich. The significant phases of U.S. involvement in Europe—from the invasion of Normandy to the final push into Germany—would demonstrate the decisive influence of American military power on the war's outcome [^1].

Though the United States' involvement in the Pacific theater grew significantly, the initial attitude of U.S. military strategy remained primarily German-focused. Their initial entry into Europe came through Italy, with the U.S. military establishing a strong physical presence in the West following their invasion in July 1943. In the winter of that year, President Roosevelt named General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Supreme Commander, marking a crucial step in Allied leadership consolidation. The establishment of the Combined Chiefs of Staff represented an unprecedented level of international military cooperation, bringing together American, British, and later Soviet military leaders to develop coordinated global strategies. This multinational planning body allowed for unprecedented coordination, ensuring that military efforts across different theaters of war were strategically aligned and mutually supportive.

Through the established Combined Chiefs of Staff, the Allies planned the "D-Day" invasion. Their efforts culminated in the cross-channel invasion of Nazi-occupied France, dubbed “Operation Overlord”. This operation would enable the Allies to open a Western Front against Germany and ultimately relieve pressure on the Soviet Union fighting on the Eastern Front. The invasion represented an almost incomprehensible logistical challenge, requiring months of intricate planning and the development of technology. Specialized landing craft, portable harbors called “Mulberry harbors,” and extensive naval and aerial bombardment preparations were critical to the operation's success [^2].

On June 6, 1944, the D-Day invasion marked the United States' first major assault in Western Europe, incorporating a massive amphibious landing by American, British, and Canadian forces along a fifty-mile stretch of beaches in Normandy. The Allies' overwhelming troop and air superiority during the invasion enabled a steady and significant advance through Western Europe, establishing a crucial front for supplies and reinforcements that would reach the battlefield in France. The Normandy invasion additionally served to halt Germany's ability to extract resources from occupied France, directly impacting the Nazi war economy and weakening Germany's ability to sustain prolonged resistance.

Following the Normandy initiative, American forces executed a series of strategic offensives through occupied France. Operation Cobra, implemented in July of 1944, achieved a breakthrough in German defensive lines in Normandy, ultimately resulting in the liberation of Paris by August of that year. The liberation was significantly supported by the French Resistance, whose underground fighters provided critical intelligence, conducted sabotage missions, and maintained communication networks that were invaluable to the Allied advance. When the French resistance initiated an uprising against the Germans, their limited resources and manpower quickly became apparent. Though Nazi control in Paris was constrained due to the city's historic and aesthetic value, with German forces avoiding destructive displays of power, it became clear the French uprising could not sustain itself indefinitely.

Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, successfully persuaded General Eisenhower to intervene. On August 24, Leclerc's forces entered Paris from the south while Patton's men advanced through the southeast, creating an initial breakthrough in German defenses before pushing through the city. German Commander Choltitz, facing the possibility of being overtaken, ultimately dismissed Hitler's orders to destroy the city and chose to surrender in response to mounting Allied pressure [^3].

Forces under General George S. Patton demonstrated tactical proficiency as they advanced eastward. This sustained momentum enabled Allied forces to systematically dismantle German control throughout France, creating the conditions necessary for the final German confrontation.

On December 16, 1944, Germany launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Ardennes Forest, aiming to split the Allied lines and recapture the port of Antwerp. This operation, which would become known as the Battle of the Bulge, represented Germany's final attempt to repel the Allies and retake territory in Western Europe. The initial attack was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of eastern Belgium and northeast France, but American forces at Elsenborn Ridge managed to stall German advances through their control of key travel routes [^4].

The resulting battle produced the highest American casualties of any operation throughout the war, but it also severely weakened German armed forces and effectively eliminated their air force. Following the Battle of the Bulge, Allied forces advanced rapidly toward Germany. In March 1945, American troops achieved a significant breakthrough by crossing the Rhine at Remagen, enabling deeper penetration into German territory [^5].

This advance facilitated the encirclement of German forces in the Ruhr Pocket, where tens of thousands of German soldiers surrendered to American and Allied forces. The capture of the Ruhr, Germany's industrial base, marked a definitive decline in the Nazi war effort and effectively destroyed their remaining defenses [^6]. Throughout their advancement, American troops liberated concentration camps, including Buchenwald and Dachau, uncovering the full extent of Nazi atrocities. These discoveries, brought to public attention by Allied and American troops, reinforced the Allies' resolve to bring the war to a definitive end and underscored the moral imperative behind the campaign.

By April 1945, American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe River, a historic junction that symbolized the effective partition of Germany and the impending fall of the Third Reich. This meeting of Allied forces from East and West marked the final chapter in the defeat of Nazi Germany, highlighting the crucial role that American military intervention had played in securing victory in Europe [^7].


# Analysis 3 - The Pacific Theatre (Victoria)

On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked a U.S. naval base located in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, ultimately redefining America’s role and involvement in World War II. Japan's ambition to spread throughout Southeast Asia was their justification for the attack, which aimed to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet in order to stop American interference [^8]. The results were devastating and deadly: eight battleships were hit, hundreds of aircraft were destroyed, and over two thousand Americans lost their lives. However, Japan’s mistakes overshadowed their victory. The United States was able to quickly recover from the attack because major repair facilities and aircraft carriers were absent during the attack [^9]. This battle destroyed any remaining isolationist views in the United States, pushing President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 as "a date which will live in infamy" due to widespread outrage, strengthening American resolve to stand with the Allied Powers against the Axis [^10]. The attack being a major turning point in the war, from an American perspective, the United States was inspired by this catastrophe, which paved the way for its active involvement in the Pacific theater.

The Battle of Midway, taking place June 4th to June 7th of the following year, marked America’s first major response to Japan’s attack. Japan targeted Midway Atoll in an attempt to destroy any surviving American naval power after Pearl Harbor was destroyed. Under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Japan devised their strategy to ambush the American fleet [^11]. American Admiral Chester Nimitz, however, had vital information about Japanese activities thanks to American cryptographers who had deciphered Japanese transmissions [^12]. So, the United States positioned The USS Enterprise, USS Hornet, and USS Yorktown, three U.S. aircraft carriers, against the Japanese navy. Four Japanese carriers were destroyed in the battle while the United States only lost the USS Yorktown, a large victory for the United States navy [^13]. Midway emphasized the importance of intelligence and carrier based warfare and allowed the United States to shift its emphasis from defensive attacks to offensive ones.

On August 7, 1942, the United States launched the Battle of Guadalcanal as they did not want to lose their momentum from the battle of Midway. The United States launched a full scale attack to stop Japanese expansion after realizing that their construction on Guadalcanal threatened Allied supply routes. The six month long battle included intense jungle warfare, scarce supplies, and significant losses on both sides [^14]. As American air, land, and sea forces showed unparalleled coordination to seize control of the island, Guadalcanal became a test of the U.S. Marines' endurance [^15]. With this success, the Allies began an "island hopping" campaign, attacking islands in the Pacific instead of heavily fortified locations [^16]. By capturing Guadalcanal, the United States effectively altered the trajectory of the war by weakening Japan's position in the area. By strengthening American determination, this fight set the stage for Allied achievements that would eventually force Japan to retreat. 

The Battle of Leyte Gulf, taking place from October 23 to October 26, 1943, was a major battle in weakening Japan’s naval power in the Pacific. The battle began when the United States launched submarines to attack Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita’s Center Force. The attack led to the sinking of Atago, a Japanese cruiser, which alerted American commanders to Japanese movements [^17]. On October 24, the U.S. launched carrier planes to strike the Center Force in the battle of the Sibuyan Sea, sinking  the Musashi battleship, ultimately forcing Kurita to retreat, even if it was temporary. Later, on that same day, the United States forces destroyed the Japanese Southern Force with  their “crossing the ‘T’” strategy in the Surigao Strait, marking this battle as the last one in naval history to have involved battleships. The next day, October 25, 1943, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita launched Japan’s remaining ships to attack the unsuspecting, and therefore basically unarmed, U.S. Task Unit, “Taffy 3,” off the coast of Samar. Though they suffered major losses from this attack, America was able to force Japan to retreat, once again [^18]. At the same time, American Admiral William Halsey Jr. was pursuing the Japanese fleet, the Northern Force, which turned out to be a decoy, whilst the American fleet successfully destroyed Japanese aircraft carriers in the Battle off Cape Engaño. While Admiral William Halsey was focused primarily on the Northern Force, he left the San Bernardino Strait unprotected. Using the strait, the Japanese could reach Leyte Gulf, where American forces were landing. Fortunately, even though the opportunity to attack the U.S. forces in Leyte Gulf were present, Admiral Kurita decided to withdraw his forces due to the damages sustained in the battle [^19]. This success for the US was so impactful, it was even expressed by President Rooselvelt in a letter to General MacArther, Roosevelt praising him and thanking him on behalf of Americans. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was the catalyst in ending the Japanese Navy’s ability to run major operations and it introduced Japan’s kamikaze tactics. 

America’s island-hopping strategy, as it began after the Battle of Midway, played a major role in their victories in the Pacific in World War 2. The strategy aimed to capture significant islands in the pacific while also avoiding Japanese strongholds [^20]. This strategy encouraged the conservation of resources and the minimization of injuries and deaths by targeting islands that weren’t heavily fortified. Island-hopping reflected how adaptable and efficient the United States’ approach to the war was, balancing out objectives with immediate needs to hinder Japan’s military and its operations [^21]. The strategy proved especially successful in Guadalcanal and Okinawa, but overall was a catalyst in many American victories during World War 2.
