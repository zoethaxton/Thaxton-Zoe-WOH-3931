# Conclusion (Collin)

Throughout the world, America’s impact could be felt when they joined the Allied Powers during the Second World War. From the Pacific Theatre, to North Africa and the Mediterranean, to Europe, both America’s industries and military forces impacted the war effort dramatically. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, they knew that they were putting America on the path to war, awakening the sleeping giant, but they could have never imagined how much this decision would affect the geopolitical climate of the rest of the 20th century. America entering the Second World War directly impacted America’s foreign policy; turning them from an isolationist power to an interventionist one, acting as the powerhouse for the west and containing the spread of communism. After World War II, America aided in the economic reconstruction and stabilization of Europe through the Marshall Plan. In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was signed. NATO outlined methods of cooperation between its members, primarily militarily, but also economically. Most crucial to NATO’s existence was the existence of the threat of the Soviet Union. NATO’s answer to this aggression was Article 5: “an armed attack against one or more of them… shall be considered an attack against them all.” NATO first bore its teeth during the Korean War. To organize aid for their South Korean allies, NATO founded the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and appointed the American general Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Allied Commander. America’s habit of influencing affairs outside of its borders wasn’t limited to across the Atlantic either. America influenced the governments of Latin American countries to stop a multitude of socialist movements. America's involvement in World War II transformed its foreign policy, establishing its role as a global power. NATO’s formation marked its commitment to collective security, while interventions in Latin America demonstrated its determination to counter socialism. These actions, rooted in its entry into the war, cemented America’s influence on global affairs throughout the 20th century.
